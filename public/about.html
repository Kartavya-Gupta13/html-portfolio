<h1>About Me:</h1>
<hr />

<p>Welcome to my website! My name is Kartavya Gupta, and I am a passionate learner in the exciting realm of Full Stack Web Development.</p>

<p>Ever since I delved into the world of coding, I found myself captivated by the art of crafting immersive and functional web experiences. The ability to build both the front-end, where creativity knows no bounds, and the back-end, where logic and functionality come to life, is what truly excites me about Full Stack Web Development.</p>

<p>I believe that continuous learning is the key to personal growth and professional success. With each project I undertake and every line of code I write, I am committed to honing my skills and expanding my knowledge in this dynamic field.</p>

<p>My journey began with the fundamental web technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and it has evolved to encompass cutting-edge frameworks and libraries like React, Node.js, and Express. I thrive on challenges, and I find great satisfaction in overcoming obstacles to create elegant and efficient solutions.</p>

<p>Beyond coding, I value collaboration and teamwork. Working in diverse and inclusive environments has not only broadened my perspectives but also enriched my problem-solving abilities. I believe that through collaboration, we can build extraordinary things that surpass what any individual could achieve alone.</p>

<p>This website serves as a portfolio of my projects, experiences, and accomplishments on my path to becoming a skilled Full Stack Web Developer. I invite you to explore my work and join me on this exciting journey of continuous growth and improvement.</p>

<p>Thank you for visiting, and I look forward to connecting with you!</p>

<p>Sincerely,</p>

<p>Kartavya Gupta</p>
